This is a platform for financial exploration. It combines live data from social media feeds with cutting edge machine learning to display public opinion (sentiment) about publicly listed companies. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Enter the company names/tickers that you are interested in
2. The system analyzes social media posts relating to those companies, and shows a statistical analysis of the public opinion around them
3. You can then compare the historic prices with the public opinion at the time, and decided whether or not to invest
4. You have just completed your first financial experiment!
